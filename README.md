# TEXT BASED GAME: BLACKJACK 

# IDEA AND IMPLEMENTATION

//
Two cards are dealt to the player. The dealer shows one card face up, and the other is face down. The player gets to see both of his or her cards and the total of them is added. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth their face value. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 (“Blackjack”) without going over, which is known as a “Bust.” 

The player goes first, making his or her decisions based on the single dealer card showing. The player has two basic choices: Hit or Stand. Hit means to take another card. Stand means that the player wishes no more cards, and ends the turn, allowing for the dealer to play.

The dealer only has limited option, that is to hit until their card total is less than 17 (or a soft 17), and must stand if it is 17 or higher. 

If the dealer gets closest to 21 without exceeding it, wins.

If both the player and the dealer have the same value, it is known as a push unless one had a Blackjack with the two cards given in the start, in which case that person wins.
